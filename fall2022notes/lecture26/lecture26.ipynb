Given a list of\n","values that is in ascending sorted order, it quickly finds the index of a target\n","value $x$ in the list, or returns -1 if $x$ is not in the list. It is much\n","faster than linear search, especially for large lists.\n","\n","It works like this:\n","- Check if the middle-most element of the list is equal to $x$. If so, we're\n","  done.\n","- If $x$ is less than the middle element, then $x$ must be in the left half of\n","  the list. So we apply binary search to the left half.\n","- If $x$ is greater than the middle element, then $x$ must be in the right half\n","  of the list. So we apply binary search to the right half.\n","\n","For example, suppose the list is `[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]` and you want to find\n","the number 5. We will use variables `lo` and `hi` to keep track of the current\n","sub-list that is being searched. Initially, we search the entire list:\n","\n","```\n","looking for x = 5\n","\n","[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]\n"," ^                  ^\n"," |                  |\n","lo                  hi\n","```\n","\n","The middle element is 4. Since 5 is greater than 4, if 5 is in the list it must\n","be in the right half. So adjust `lo`:\n","\n","```\n","looking for x = 5\n","\n","[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]\n","             ^     ^\n","             |     |\n","            lo    hi\n","```\n","\n","The middle element of the current sub-list is 9. Since 5 is less than 9, if 5 is\n","in the list it must be in the left half.
