## CMPT 120 Fall 2024


June 5, 2024 note from Hester Greenwood about high school course time:

    We have roughly 80 classes, each about 1 hour 20 minutes long (give or take,
    depending on school events). Since we would be offering this as a Grade 12
    course and the students would have a lot of experience coding in Java in Gr.
    11, I would suggest moving quickly through the lessons up to and including
    Chapter 9, then taking it a bit more slowly and incorporating more projects
    in.

High school contact hours: 80 * 1.33 = 106.4 hours

     SFU contact hours: 13 * 3 = 39 hours
SFU out of class hours: 13 * 5 = 65 hours
       SFU Total hours:          104 hours
