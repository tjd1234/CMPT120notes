Set the index variable `i` to 0.\n","2. If $i = n$, then you're done: return -1 and stop. -1 means $x$ was not found.\n","3. If $a_i == x$, then you're done: return `i` and stop.\n","4. Otherwise, increment `i` by 1 and go to step 2.\n","\n","This algorithm is called **linear search**, or **sequential search**, because it\n","checks the items, one at time, to see if they equal $x$. If it finds $x$, it\n","immediately returns the index position, $i$. If it reaches the end of the list\n","without finding $x$, it returns -1.\n","\n","This is the standard algorithm for solving the list search problem. By looking\n","at the algorithm we can see that:\n","- It is pretty efficient. It doesn't appear to do any unnecessary work, and it\n","  stops as soon as it's done.\n","- It is space-efficient. The only extra memory it requires is the variable `i`.\n","- It is not destructive. The list is *not* modified.\n","- It is quite general.

Proving that mathematically is actually a challenge, and so\n","  in practice we usually rely on careful design and testing to make sure our\n","  algorithms are correct.\n","\n","  How fast is linear search? If we had an implementation of linear search we\n","  could run an experiment on with data and time how long it takes. But we only\n","  have the algorithm, written in pseudocode, and so we have nothing to run.\n","\n","  But we can say some useful things about the performance of the linear search\n","  algorithm itself:\n","  - At *most*, it calls `==` $n$ times, where $n$ is the length of the list.\n","  - At *best*, it calls `==` once, when the first item in the list is $x$. Also,\n","    if the list is empty it will be called 0 times.\n","  - On *average*, if $x$ has the same chance of being anywhere in the list, it\n","    will call `==` approximately $\\frac{n}{2}$ times.
