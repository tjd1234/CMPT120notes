Given a list of\n","values that is in sorted order from smallest to biggest, it *very* quickly finds\n","the index of a target value $x$ in the list, or returns -1 if $x$ is not in the\n","list. \n","\n","As we will see, binary search is much faster than linear search, especially when\n","searching large lists.\n","\n","Binary search works like this:\n","- Check if the middle-most element of the list is equal to $x$. If so, we're\n","  done.\n","- If $x$ is less than the middle element, then $x$ must be in the left half of\n","  the list. So we apply binary search to the left half.\n","- If $x$ is greater than the middle element, then $x$ must be in the right half\n","  of the list. So we apply binary search to the right half.\n","\n","For example, suppose the list is `[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]` and you want to find\n","the number 5. We will use variables `lo` and `hi` to keep track of the current\n","sub-list that is being searched. Initially, we search the entire list:\n","\n","```\n","looking for x = 5\n","\n","[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]\n"," ^                  ^\n"," |                  |\n","lo                  hi\n","```\n","\n","The middle element is 4. Since 5 is greater than 4, if 5 is in the list it must\n","be in the right half. So we adjust `lo`:\n","\n","```\n","looking for x = 5\n","\n","[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]\n","             ^     ^\n","             |     |\n","            lo    hi\n","```\n","\n","The middle element of the current sub-list is 9. Since 5 is less than 9, if 5 is\n","in the list it must be in the left half. So we adjust `hi`:\n","\n","```\n","looking for x = 5\n","\n","[0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]\n","             ^\n","             |     \n","           lo, hi\n","```\n","\n","Both `lo` and `hi` are pointing to the same element, and that element is not 5.\n","So we're done: 5 is not in the list.\n","\n","Here is an implementation:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"ename":"AssertionError","evalue":"","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mAssertionError\u001b[0m                            Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipykernel_3252/3849973001.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     34\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'all binary_search tests passed!'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     35\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 36\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mbinary_search_test\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipykernel_3252/3849973001.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mbinary_search_test\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     23\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m             \u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m==\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     24\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m            \u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m==\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 25\u001b[0;31m     \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m            \u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m==\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     26\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m            \u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m==\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     27\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m         \u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m==\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mAssertionError\u001b[0m: "]}],"source":["def binary_search(x, lst):\n","    \"\"\"Returns an index i such that list[i] == x.\n","    If x is not in lst, returns -1.\n","    lst must be in sorted order, from smallest to biggest.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    lo = 0\n","    hi = len(lst) - 1\n","    while lo <= hi:\n","        mid = (lo + hi) // 2  # // is integer division\n","        if lst[mid] == x:\n","            return mid        # x found at location mid\n","        elif x < lst[mid]:\n","            hi = mid - 1\n","        else:                 # lst[mid] < x\n","            lo = mid + 1\n","    return -1                 # x not in lst\n","\n","def binary_search_test():\n","    \"\"\"Test that binary search works correctly.\n","    assert expr does nothing if expr evaluates to True.
