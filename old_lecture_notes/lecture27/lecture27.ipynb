It's basic shape is a *parabola*, i.e.\n","a **quadratic curve**. The running time of selection sort is proportional to\n","$n^2$, where $n$ is the number of items being sorted. Since $n^2$ is a quadratic\n","expression, we say that selection sort runs in **quadratic time**, i.e. the\n","running time is proportional to the *square* of the number of elements being\n","sorted.\n","\n","Notice that selection sort's graph is not smooth: it randomly wiggles up and\n","down a bit. This is because the computer occasionally does other things while\n","running Python, e.g. it might receives email, save a file in the background, be\n","running a video, etc.\n","\n","Mergesort (and the built-in sort) both run in time proportional to $n \\log_2 n$,\n","where $n$ is the number of items being sorted.
